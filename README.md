<summary>## üêç Database Update Tool</summary>

Cluster Scheduler includes a small helper program for updating the class database.

### File Location
If building from source, the Python script can be found at:
`370-project\Desktop_Qt_6_9_1_MinGW_64_bit-Release\class_finder\data_extractor`

### Options to Run It
- **Windows Users (No Python Required):**  
  Use the included `data_extractor.exe` file in the `/class_finder` folder.
  
- **Using Python Directly:**  
  1. Install [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas
     ```
  3. Run the script:
     ```bash
     python data_extractor.py
     ```

### What It Does
- Connects to the CSUSM course catalog
- Downloads the latest class data
- Updates the internal database used by Cluster Scheduler

‚ö† **Note:** Running this tool will overwrite your existing database file with the latest data.
